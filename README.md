## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/loganbu/photography-portfolio.git
    cd photography-portfolio
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Usage

1.  **Build the website:**
    Run the build script to generate the static HTML files in the `docs/` directory.
    ```bash
    node scripts/build.js
    ```
    **Note:** The `index.html` and other content pages in `docs/` are automatically generated. Do not modify them directly. Instead, edit `base.html.template` or the partials in `partials/` and then run `node scripts/build.js` to regenerate.

2.  **View the website locally:**
    Open the generated `index.html` file in your web browser.
    ```bash
    open docs/index.html
    ```

## üåê Deployment

This site is deployed via GitHub Pages from the `docs/` directory of the `main` branch.

To deploy changes:
1.  Ensure all local changes are committed to your `main` branch.
2.  Run the build script: `node scripts/build.js`
3.  Push your `main` branch to GitHub. GitHub Pages will automatically deploy the content from the `docs/` directory.
