        <h1>First Shoot?</h1>
        <p>Whether you're a beginner or a veteran, professional photos are the best way to celebrate your hard work and share your passion with those around you.</p>
        <p>Participating in a photo shoot is a collaborative performance. Read on to find out how to prepare yourself and maximise your session.</p>

        <h2>What to prepare</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Inspo</b> - What kind of feel are you aiming for? Bright or moody, graceful or bold, acrobatic or beautiful? Instagram is a great place to start.</li>
            <li><b>Costume, makeup, and props</b> - If the shoot has a particular theme, think about what you want to wear well ahead of time. Props are often forgotten. Ever not known what to do with your hands in a photo? Props are the answer!</li>
            <li><b>Moves</b> - The #1 mistake everyone makes is going too hard! Facial control is difficult when you're focusing on the rest of your body. Bring moves you are comfortable with, or practice ahead of time until they become comfortable. Also, be aware of your own stamina.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>On the day</h2>
        <p>It's showtime! Rock up well-rested with time for any makeup/costume adjustments if necessary, and get warmed up before the session begins. Shoots can become hectic, so place anything you'll use (water, grips, clothing) in a convenient location.</p>
        <p>During your session, I recommend this order:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>We will start with a warmup. The camera and lighting make an unfamiliar environment that takes time to get used to, so save your energy while you get used to the rhythm of the shoot.</li>
            <li>When you feel more comfortable, spend most of the shoot alternating between safe moves and flow. You can repeat poses, especially if there is a lighting or costume change! You will want to give yourself options for the edit and you will also find yourself improving throughout the shoot.</li>
            <li>Once you have done your safe poses, try any nice-to-haves. These should make up the smallest portion of your shoot because when you're pushing hard, there's no guarantee that your expressions and toes will be what you think they are!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>After the shoot</h2>
        <p>Well done, you made it! Now you can relax and recover.</p>
        <p>I will remove any dud/test photos and perform simple edits so you can get an idea of what your photos will look like. These drafts, 'proofs', will normally be provided within 1-3 days.</p>
        <p>Take time to select your photos for a full professional edit. The best way to communicate your selection is with the unique number in the filenames. You can also make special requests, such as crops for various media types or black & white. Almost all requests will be included in your base fee, but I will let you know if a request is particularly complex.</p>
        <p>Once you have given me your selection, I will complete the full edits and send you a high-quality download, normally within 7 days. You can request any adjustments (excluding major retouching)</p>
        <p>If you would like any changes at any point, it is never too late! I back up and retain the original files indefinitely.</p>
        <p>Thanks for reading, and have fun!</p>
