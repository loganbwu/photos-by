        <h1>Standard Agreement</h1>
        <p>By signing up for the shoot, you (the client or performer) enter into this agreement with me (the photographer):</p>

        <h2>What do you get?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>You get a time slot&nbsp;on the pole at the venue. As the photographer,&nbsp;I aim to make the most of this time for you, so I do as much setup as I can beforehand. Similarly, you should be warm and ready to go at the start of your session.</li>
            <li>I will deliver a set number of professionally edited photos, plus any extras you request.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you have any particular requests, I am usually happy to accommodate!</p>

        <h2>Cancellation</h2>
        <p>If the shoot is cancelled due to myself or the venue, you may choose between a full refund or a reshoot (if possible). Otherwise, I will will still do my best to offer a reshoot or partial refund, depending on any expenses such as travel. The best outcome for everyone is always a reshoot!</p>
        <p>If you need to cancel ahead of time, a refund is normally possible where we can find a replacement. By making a booking, you understand that your session slot is reserved for you, forgoing other clients.</p>

        <h2>Safety</h2>
        <p>You accept the risk of injury that is inherent in acrobatic and aerial sports and will only perform activities you are confident in doing safely, including through the usage of safety equipment.&nbsp;I am not trained in the setup of poles and rigging and will only assist if supervised by someone who is.</p>
        <p>Photography/videography involve extra hazards that the performer may have not encountered before.&nbsp;To minimise risks, I will ensure lighting and photography equipment are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Positioned safely in relation to the performer and nearby people,</li>
            <li>On appropriately sized and/or weighted stands to minimise the risk of falling, or</li>
            <li>Hazards notified to the performer and nearby people&nbsp;if the other two precautions will prevent the main photography/videography goals.</p>
        </ol>
        <p>You are always entitled to bring a friend with you, even if they are&nbsp;not participating in the shoot.</p>

        <h2>Delivery and payment</h2>
        <p>1. Proofs will be delivered within ten business days of the shoot. In the past, I have always delivered within two days.</p>
        <p>2. Edits will be delivered within ten business days of the client informing the photographer of their order. Revisions&nbsp;(e.g., alterations or new selections) reset this time. In the past, I have delivered within 3-5 days.</p>
        <p>4. Photo selections&nbsp;where work has begun&nbsp;can only be be&nbsp;swapped&nbsp;at the photographer's discretion.</p>
        <p>5. Final photos will be delivered via cloud storage (Google Drive).</p>
        <p>6. The delivery window closes 60 days after the shoot. The photographer may archive or delete all media.</p>

        <h2>Copyright/licensing</h2>
        <p>Upon final payment, you are entitled to unlimited and unrestricted usage of your delivered&nbsp;photos. This includes distribution and modification for personal and commercial use. 'Proof' photos (sent after the shoot for selection) and previews during the shoot&nbsp;are not included. Copyright for media captured on the photographer's equipment remains with the photographer.</p>
        <p>You are free to take and share any photos/videos of the shoot process, as long as everyone in them consents!</p>
