        <h1>Your Photography Session Agreement</h1>
        <p>By booking a photoshoot, you (the Client/Performer) agree to the following terms with me (the Photographer).</p>

        <h2>What's Included in Your Session?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dedicated Time Slot:</strong> You get an allocated time slot on the pole at the venue. I’ll do as much setup as possible beforehand to maximise our shooting time. Please arrive warmed up and ready to start.</li>
            <li><strong>Professionally Edited Photos:</strong> You’ll receive a set number of professionally edited photos. Additional photos can be requested.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Have specific requests? I’m usually happy to accommodate them!</p>

        <h2>Cancellations and Rescheduling</h2>
        <p><strong>If I or the venue cancels:</strong> You can choose a full refund or a rescheduled shoot (if possible).</p>
        <p><strong>If other issues arise:</strong> I'll do my best to offer a reshoot or a partial refund. A reshoot is generally the best outcome for everyone.</p>
        <p><strong>If you need to cancel:</strong> A refund is usually possible if we can find someone to take your slot. Please understand that booking reserves your time, meaning other clients cannot book that slot.</p>

        <h2>Safety</h2>
        <p><strong>Your Responsibility:</strong> You acknowledge the inherent risks in acrobatic and aerial sports. Only perform moves you can do safely, using safety equipment where necessary. I am not trained in pole/rigging setup and will only assist if supervised by a qualified person.</p>
        <p><strong>My Responsibility (Equipment Safety):</strong> Photography and videography can introduce new hazards. To minimise risks, I will ensure all lighting and photography equipment is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Positioned safely away from performers and others.</li>
            <li>Secured on appropriately sized and/or weighted stands to prevent falls.</li>
            <li>If the above isn't possible without compromising the shoot, any remaining hazards will be clearly communicated to you and anyone nearby.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You’re welcome to bring a friend to the shoot, even if they aren’t participating.</p>

        <h2>Photo Delivery and Payment</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Proofs:</strong> Delivered within 10 business days of the shoot (typically within 2 days).</li>
            <li><strong>Final Edits:</strong> Delivered within 10 business days after you confirm your selections. Revisions (e.g., changes to selections or alteration requests) will reset this timeframe (typically delivered within 3-5 days).</li>
            <li><strong>Changing Selections:</strong> Once I’ve started working on your selected photos, changes can only be made at my discretion.</li>
            <li><strong>Receiving Your Photos:</strong> Final photos will be delivered via cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive).</li>
            <li><strong>Access Window:</strong> Your photos will be available for 60 days after the shoot. After this, I may archive or delete all media.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Photo Usage and Copyright</h2>
        <p><strong>Your Rights:</strong> Once final payment is made, you receive unlimited and unrestricted rights to use your delivered photos. This includes sharing, printing, and modifying them for personal and commercial purposes.</p>
        <p><strong>Not Included:</strong> This does not apply to 'proof' photos (low-resolution images sent for selection) or any previews shown during the shoot.</p>
        <p><strong>Photographer's Copyright:</strong> Copyright for all media captured on my equipment remains with me, the Photographer.</p>
        <p>You’re free to take and share your own photos/videos during the shoot, as long as everyone in them consents!</p>

        <h2>Any Questions?</h2>
        <p>Just ask! I'm happy to clarify anything.</p>
